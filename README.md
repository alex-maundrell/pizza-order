This is a simple program that has 3 varying inputs and outputs the total amount for the bill.

While writing this one again, I was thinking of adding a 'while' loop. I added a line of code that will only appear when the user enters an incorrect size, BUT, the program just exits...it will not start over for the user to try again. This wouldn't be good for a text based website. I realize that if this were GUI, chances are very high that this would eliminate errors entered by the user.

I am taking a Python course through udemy.com. The instructor is Dr. Angela Yu. During this course there are many 'coding challenges' and other projects. The course name is: 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023. 

I have decided to break up the many challenges and projects by going through 10 days of the course, then revisiting every challenge. I believe this will strengthen my coding knowledge that I am aquiring in this course. My goal is to not look at the code that I have already done for the challenge and complete the running program again of my own volition.

I will have of course my code in these challenges and projects, as well as the instructions that I was given originally to complete them.

These README's will be cut and paste. The only changes I will make for each repository are (1) The section of days in the course where this program falls and (2) Whether or not I had to look at my final solution to finish this program.

As of this moment, the GitHub licenses are a little confusing. I'm sure I will pick up on them relatively quickly. All I can say for sure is that I do not have express consent to call these challenges my own; they are part of the course that I am taking.

This challenge is in between days: 1 - 10

I did not have to look at the solution to complete this challenge.
(I am not writing that line for anyone but myself when I look back on these challenges as I grow with my coding career)
